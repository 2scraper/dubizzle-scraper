"""dubizzle-scraper — Selenium edition

A parity engine, kept for stacks that already have Selenium. It must behave
identically to `playwright_scraper.py`: the same flags, the same rows in the
same column order, the same exit codes and the same run status. Verified on a
live two-page run — 48 rows, identical `sku` set, 44 identical columns
(2026-09-11).

Two hard limits of this driver, stated here rather than left to be
discovered:

* **It cannot use an authenticated remote CDP endpoint.** Playwright's
  `connect_over_cdp` and pyppeteer's `browserWSEndpoint` take a full
  `ws://user:pass@host:port` and authenticate on the WebSocket upgrade;
  chromedriver's `debuggerAddress` takes a bare `host:port` with nowhere to
  put a password. A credentialled `--cdp-endpoint` is refused here with that
  explanation rather than silently dropping the credentials.
* **`--proxy-server` cannot authenticate at all.** Credentials are stripped
  and a warning printed. The way round it on this site is 2Captcha's
  IP-whitelist mode, which hands out `host:port` connections with no
  credentials in them — those work here exactly as they do in the other two
  engines, and one was used for this engine's live run.

And two things about the site itself: it refuses a HEADLESS browser whatever
the exit address, so `--headful` is the default; and the rows come from the
SSR payload while only the money comes from the hydrated card, so readiness
waits for a populated price node rather than for a card count.
