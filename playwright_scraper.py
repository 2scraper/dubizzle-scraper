"""dubizzle-scraper — Playwright edition (primary engine)

Scrapes dubizzle's UAE listing grids: cars, property, classifieds, jobs and
community services, 25 or 35 ads a page, paginated by `?page=N`.

    --mode listing  (the only mode) a category grid on uae.dubizzle.com —
                    /motors/used-cars/, /property-for-rent/residential/…,
                    /classified/electronics/televisions/, /jobs/…,
                    /community/…, with or without the site's own filters

There is deliberately no `--country` flag and no detail-page mode. The
language is a path segment on a single platform, so a country flag could only
disagree with the URL it was given; a detail mode is not shipped because the
ad pages were not measured, and a mode whose markup nobody has read is a mode
that reports success without checking (§8).

WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS SITE
---------------------------------
* **Imperva refuses an address outside the UAE, and no browser setting fixes
  that.** Measured 2026-09-14: a European residential exit was refused with
  HTTP 403 and a 1,160-byte "Request unsuccessful. Incapsula incident ID"
  page — headful Chrome and plain HTTP alike — and a Finnish datacentre exit
  got the 6,183-byte "Pardon Our Interruption" page under **HTTP 200**. A UAE
  residential exit was served the full 1.6 MB catalogue by headless Chromium.
  So `page_flow.RETRY_ON_BLOCKED` is True here and the advice is about the
  exit's COUNTRY, not about the window. `--cdp-endpoint` with `country-ae` in
  the Scraping Browser login is the path measured to work.

* **The refusal can be transient.** The first live run of this engine had
  page 1 come back blocked and cleared it on one re-fetch through the same
  endpoint, which is why the without-a-pool block budget is 1 rather than the
  family's 0.

* **The rows come from the site's own SSR payload, not from JSON-LD.**
  `__NEXT_DATA__` carries every ad on every vertical; JSON-LD carries an
  ItemList on motors and property and NOTHING on classified, jobs and
  community. A JSON-LD-primary parser would work on cars and flats and
  silently return nothing on half the site.

* **JSON-LD is still read, as an enrichment.** It is the only place `brand`,
  the dealership's name and `offers.availability` are stated. It is joined on
  the ad's locale-stripped PATH, not on its URL: an Arabic listing publishes
  `/ar/...` in its JSON-LD while its payload publishes no `/ar` at all, and a
  URL-keyed join matched 25 of 25 ads in English and 0 of 25 in Arabic.

* **There is no scroll, and that is measured.** Three captures taken with no
  scrolling at all carried the same 25 payload hits and 25 rendered tiles as
  the captures taken with four scroll rounds. A sibling repo cannot see one
  product without its scroll loop, which is exactly why this was checked
  here rather than ported.

* **Pagination is the site's own count.** Page 1's payload states
  `totalPages` directly — 400 on a 34,619-ad motors listing, 2,286 on both
  property indexes — so every page's address is knowable at once and workers
  can be handed independent pages. Past the end the site does not clamp, it
  EMPTIES: `?page=401` and `?page=99999` both answered HTTP 200 with
  `totalPages: 0, totalHits: 0`.

* **A page past the end still renders one ad.** It is the promoted Car of
  the Week, complete with a price node and a JSON-LD item, so an `empty`
  page is deliberately not parsed — parsing one would write a plausible
  phantom row for every page a run overshot by.

* **`price` is legitimately null on two verticals.** A jobs ad publishes no
  salary (0 of 25) and a community services ad usually publishes no fee (1
  of 25), so the price-coverage floor is per-vertical and is 0 for both.

Examples
--------
    python3 playwright_scraper.py \\
        --url "https://uae.dubizzle.com/motors/used-cars/" --pages 3

    python3 playwright_scraper.py \\
        --url "https://uae.dubizzle.com/property-for-rent/residential/apartmentflat/" \\
        --pages 2 --format csv

    # Arabic: the locale is the URL, not a flag.
    python3 playwright_scraper.py \\
        --url "https://uae.dubizzle.com/ar/motors/used-cars/"

The site does not geo-redirect between languages: `/ar` is a path segment,
and the price is AED for every visitor.
