"""page_flow.py — what to do with the page dubizzle just gave us.

dubizzle answers a request five ways, and four of them want a different
response, which is why this module exists rather than the same triage being
written three times inside three engines and drifting apart (§1):

    content    the site served its listing payload
    empty      a search that matched nothing -- and it comes with 24
               suggested lots in the grid, so this state must NOT be parsed
    shell      served, built from the site's own assets, payload not there
               yet. Wants a WAIT, not a refetch
    challenge  something solvable was rendered
    blocked    HTTP 403 from Akamai's edge with a 394-byte "Access Denied"

The policy lives in `STATE_POLICY` as DATA, so an engine cannot quietly
disagree with its twins about whether a page is worth retrying or worth
paying for.

Everything here is pure or driven through small callables, so each engine
passes its own driver's primitives and keeps its browser plumbing to itself:

    count(selector) -> int          how many elements match
    content() -> Optional[str]      current HTML, None if unavailable
    sleep(ms) -> None               wait

No JavaScript crosses that boundary in either direction (§1): Selenium's
`execute_script` takes a function BODY with an explicit `return` where
Playwright and pyppeteer take `() => expr`, so the shared module names the
OPERATION and the engine spells it in its own driver's dialect.

This module has NO scroll loop, and that is measured rather than assumed
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Three scrolls to `document.body.scrollHeight` added exactly zero cards and
did not change the page height on any of the three page kinds (24 -> 24 on a
category listing, 24 -> 24 on a search grid, 40 -> 40 on a lot page). Every
listing page holds its whole 24 lots and paginates by URL, so a scroll here
would be latency bought for nothing. The opposite of a sibling repo, where
the scroll is the only way any product is ever seen -- which is exactly why
this was checked instead of ported.

# Readiness
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The trap this site sets, and the reason the anchor is not a card count.
#
# Both listing kinds are SERVER-RENDERED, but what the server renders is the
# card's SHELL: the first response carries 24 `c-lot-card__container` nodes
# and 24 `c-lot-card__price` nodes, and every one of those price nodes is
# EMPTY (measured on the raw response body, before any script ran: 0 of 24
# non-empty, no status labels, no favourite counts). The money, the bid state
# and the favourite count all arrive at hydration.
#
# So a readiness wait on the card count is satisfied instantly, at 24 out of
# 24, while every price on the page is still blank -- §8's "a selector
# matching the WRONG element is worse than one matching nothing", in the
# shape it takes here. The anchor is therefore a price node WITH SOMETHING IN
# IT.
#
# Rows survive either way: title, url, sku, images, auction id and the
# reserve flag all come out of the SSR payload with no JavaScript at all (24
# rows parsed from the raw response, every one of them `price_source:
# next_data`). A timed-out wait costs the prices, not the run.
READY_SELECTOR_LISTING = ".c-lot-card__price:not(:empty)"

# A lot page needs NO wait: everything a row is built from -- the amount, the
# absolute open/close times, the bid history, the sold and reserve flags, the
# estimate, the seller, the specifications -- is in the first response's
# payload, and the DOM is deliberately not read there at all (a lot page
# renders 20-40 OTHER lots' prices in the same class a listing uses for its
# own). The selector is kept only so an engine has something to hand
