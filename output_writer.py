output_writer.py
-----------------
Shared row models + JSON/CSV writers used by all three scrapers.

Two modes, one row shape
------------------------
    --mode listing   a search grid or a category listing -> Product
    --mode product   one /{shop}/{slug} detail page -> Product, with the
                     trailing detail-only fields populated

The listing and lot modes yield the SAME class, because here a lot page is not a
different kind of object from a tile — it is the same product described more
fully. So there is no second dataclass here (a sibling repo needs one for
reviews; this one does not), and `diff_runs.py` can compare a listing run
against a product run on the columns both populate.

There is deliberately no `--mode seller`. A seller's own page is its own
application shell with its own markup, none of which has been captured or
measured, and a mode that ships untested would be worse than a mode that is
absent. `product_parser.shop_metadata` reads the seller's facts off a detail
page for the sidecar, which is what a run covering one product can honestly
say about its seller.

`Product` keeps the family's first sixteen columns in the family's order,
with this site's own ones appended after `position`, so a consumer
written against another repo in this family still reads the prefix unchanged.

Everything below is row-class-agnostic: pass `row_cls` so an empty CSV still
gets the right header for the mode that produced it.

# thing that works: the site publishes NO `link[rel=next]` and no numbered
# anchors anywhere, a CATEGORY listing is addressable by `?page=N`, and a
# SEARCH is not addressable at all — `?page=2` there returns an empty result
# set rather than page 2. So "no new products" is the one termination
# condition available on a search. See page_flow.pagination_is_addressable.

# "single_page_mode" is complete by construction: --mode product reads one
# page because one page is all there is.
