"""product_parser.py — dubizzle lot extraction. This module IS the site.

Everything dubizzle-specific lives here: how a lot is recognised, where its
data actually is, how pagination is addressed, and how a served page is told
apart from a refusal. The engines carry a handful of named constants and
nothing else.

Where the data is, and why it is not where you would expect
-----------------------------------------------------------
dubizzle is a Next.js site, and the primary path is its own SSR payload,
`<script id="__NEXT_DATA__">`. Not JSON-LD: a category page publishes exactly
one `ItemList` block carrying only `name`, `url` and `image` — no price, no
bid, no id — and a search page and a lot page publish **none at all**
(measured on 17 captures, 2026-09-10). A JSON-LD-primary parser here would
have produced a title-and-image scraper with no prices in it.

    page kind                     SSR key                      JSON-LD
    /{loc}/c/{id}-{slug}          pageProps.categoryLots       1 x ItemList
    /{loc}/s?q=                   pageProps.searchLots         0
    /{loc}/l/{id}-{slug}          pageProps.lotDetailsData     0
                                  + pageProps.biddingBlockResponse
                                  + pageProps.auction
    /{loc}/a                      -- (client-side)             0

A listing's payload has NO BID in it. Bids arrive client-side over PubNub
(`pubnubChannel`), so on a LISTING the money is only in the hydrated DOM and
the SSR supplies everything else. On a LOT PAGE the opposite is true:
`biddingBlockResponse` carries the amount, the absolute open/close times, the
bid history and the sold/reserve flags, so the DOM is not needed and must not
be used — a lot page renders a "similar lots" carousel of 30+ OTHER lots'
prices in the same `c-lot-card__price` class the listing uses for its own
(§4's junk-link data theft, in a new costume).

What `price` means on an auction site
------------------------------------
Three different quantities share one node, told apart only by a label in the
page's language:

    lot_status_current_bid     a live high bid
    lot_status_final_bid       the last bid on a closed lot
    lot_status_starting_bid    nobody has bid at all — a floor, not a bid

`bid_kind` records which one `price` is. Conflating them would put "what
someone paid" and "what nobody has offered" in one column, and would make
every diff between two runs read as a price change when all that happened is
that an auction closed.

# Vendor markers are deliberately SHORT of `akamai`. dubizzle IS fronted by
# Akamai and its refusal is an Akamai page -- but the string appears in the
# response HEADER (`server: AkamaiGHost`), not in the body of a good page or
# a bad one: 0 occurrences in all six captures checked. §18's rule is that a
# marker matching a good page is worse than no marker; the corollary is that
# a marker matching NEITHER is not a marker at all.
#
# Two sets, because §8's "detected is not blocking" begins with not calling
# them the same thing:

#                          answer.
#   BOT_CHALLENGE_MARKERS  something solvable was rendered. This is the only
#                          set `--solve-captcha` acts on.
#
# The refusal is 394 bytes of "Access Denied" carrying a reference id and no
# vendor name, so the reference host is the one durable string in it.
BLOCK_MARKERS = (

# dubizzle rendered none of these to an anonymous visitor across 19 captures
# and 6 locales, and -- unlike a sibling repo in this family -- it ships no
# captcha mount point and no site key in its page config either
# (`<captcha-widgets>` and `CAPTCHA_SITE_KEY`: 0 occurrences on every
# capture). Those are another site's findings and were checked before being
# believed here. This set is therefore forward-looking: the shapes a
# challenge WOULD take, kept so that an appearance is recognised instead of
# being reported as an empty page.

# There is NO extension-tag stripping here, and that is a measurement rather
# than an oversight. The Scraping Browser's auto-solve extension does inject
# its own hunters into every page it loads: a CDP capture of a perfectly good
# listing page carries 16 `chrome-extension://` scripts, among them
# `recaptcha/hunter.js`, plus a `data-ts-input="cf-turnstile-response"`
# attribute. But none of the markers above matches that capture even WITHOUT
# stripping -- measured: `detect_bot_challenge` returns None and
# `detect_page_state` returns "content" on it -- so the guard §8 describes
# would be code that looks load-bearing and never runs (§17).
#
# Add it back together WITH any broadening of the set above. A bare
# `recaptcha`, a bare `cf-turnstile` or a hunter path are exactly the strings
# the extension puts on good pages.
