"""dubizzle-scraper — pyppeteer edition

A parity engine. pyppeteer is effectively unmaintained and its own README
points at Playwright; this exists so the family has three drivers behind one
row schema, not because it is the better choice.

It must behave identically to `playwright_scraper.py`: the same flags, the
same rows in the same column order, the same exit codes and the same run
status. Verified on a live two-page run against the same URL — 48 rows,
identical `sku` set, 44 identical columns (2026-09-11).

Two things about this site that shape every engine here:

* it refuses a HEADLESS browser whatever the exit address, so `--headful` is
  the default and `--headless` will report exit 3 today;
* the rows come from the SSR payload and only the money comes from the
  hydrated card, so readiness waits for a populated price node rather than
  for a card count.

`--fingerprint` and `--locale` are absent from this engine and present in the
others; that difference is documented in the README and asserted in the
suite, so closing it needs a README edit rather than a quiet patch.
